# UK-Road-accident-data
UK road traffice accident data for year 2020 was analysed uisng python and SQL.
The aim of the study is to identify time, day, areas with most accidents, apply apriori algorithm to explore impact of some selected variables on accident severity, and detect outliers using outlier detection methods.
The study showed the following: 
Concentration of accident in the south east of UK, West Midlands and part of the North West.
Most accidents occurred late afternoon/evening.
Friday has the highest counts while Sunday has the least count.
Cars accounted for the highest number of vehicle type that was involved in accident, followed pedal cycles and Goods vehicle 3.5 tonnes max. However, the combined accidents of all categories of motorcycle will place it 3rd.
The KMeans showed concentration of accidents at latitude between 53.7 and 53.8 corresponds with longitude between -0.5 and -0.2;latitude between 53.5 and 53.6 corresponds with longitude between 0.0 and -0.2.
Noticeably, heavy cluster is found in Hull. For Humber, two regions, [Scunthorpe and Grimsby] located in North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire (collapsed into Humberside) have clusters. This indicate that the a high rate of accidents in this area.
East Riding of York has sparsely dispersed datapoints which means fewer number of accidents in this region.
Apriori revealed that weather condition, light condition, road surface and weather condition had much impact on accisent severity.
